# Hello, I'm Hadi Sabrine 

I'm a first-year student in Computer Engineering and Artificial Intelligence.  
I'm still a beginner, and my main goal is to **learn how to code** and create **various projects**.  

I am interested in projects involving:  
- Python  
- Java  
- HTML & Web Development  
- Data Science  

I want to gain experience and improve my coding skills through practical projects.
